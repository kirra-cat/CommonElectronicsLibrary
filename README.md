This project is the conversion of the [common-electronics-library](https://github.com/kirra-cat/common-electronics-library) library from Eagle CAD to Altium Designer (only schematic symbols).

I hope that this work will be useful :).

If you have questions, wishes, recommendations, or you wish to join the work then
I can be contacted in the following ways (in descending order of preference):
- create a discussion in [repositories](https://github.com/kirra-cat/CommonElectronicsLibrary/issues);
- by email [sergey.s.sklyarov@gmail.com](mailto:sergey.s.sklyarov@gmail.com);
